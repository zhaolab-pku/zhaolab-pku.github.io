Our lab, together with Dr. Kun Song's lab and Professor Liangyi Chen's lab, successfully organised Expansion Microscopy Workshop at NBIC of Peking University, which was led by Dr. Mojtaba R. Tavakoli, who invented LICONN technology. The workshop hosted around 30 scientists nationwide and shared state-of-the-art technology.

#### Training Workshop (Huairou Campus, Jan 11-14, 2025)
A 4-day workshop on expansion microscopy was held at Peking University's National Biomedical Imaging Center. 45 participants (from Tsinghua, PKU, Fudan, etc.) learned to analyze neural circuit assembly by expanding brain tissue 16× via pan-protein staining and immunofluorescence, achieving nanoscale resolution for synaptic structures. Hands-on experiments covered tissue processing to imaging, guided by Dr. Tavakoli. Attendees reported substantial technical gains and networking opportunities.

#### Lecture at PKU Main Campus (Jan 15, 2025)
Dr. Tavakoli presented super-resolution optical microscopy for multi-scale brain research (molecular to behavioral levels), introducing LICONN technology—integrating expansion microscopy, imaging, and automated reconstruction for cross-species applications (humans, rodents, flies). Limitations and future prospects were discussed.


The event fostered deep knowledge exchange among domestic experts, advancing expansion microscopy in international collaboration.

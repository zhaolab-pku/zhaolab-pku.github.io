The National Biomedical Imaging Center (NBIC) at Peking University was established in September 2020 as an important strategic initiative by Peking University to advance the construction of national major scientific and technological infrastructure and the “Double First-Class” initiative. NBIC is a physical research institution.

Peking University leverages its multidisciplinary strengths to build the “13th Five-Year Plan” national major scientific and technological infrastructure project—the Multi-Modality Cross-Scale Biomedical Imaging Facility—dedicated to exploring cutting-edge scientific questions and tackling major technological challenges. As the primary entity responsible for the construction and operation of the imaging facility, NBIC focuses on frontier exploration and technological innovation in the field of biomedical imaging science, providing technical support for basic life sciences and medical research, and offering solutions to major issues in life and health. Additionally, it promotes the innovative development of biomedical imaging technology to facilitate the early realization of “Chinese innovation” in advanced scientific research and medical equipment.

NBIC takes the national facility as a leading force, balancing free exploration and organized innovation, vigorously developing scientific research based on large-scale scientific facilities, and striving to achieve more “from 0 to 1” original innovations. Relying on large-scale scientific facilities, it promotes the construction of the interdisciplinary field of “imagingomics,” drives paradigm shifts in scientific research within the life sciences, and cultivates future-oriented innovative talent in “large-scale science” as well as interdisciplinary innovative talent in “new engineering” and “new medicine.”

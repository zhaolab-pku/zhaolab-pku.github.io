 abstract = {The bone marrow in the skull is important for shaping immune responses in the brain and meninges, but its molecular makeup among bones and relevance in human diseases remain unclear. Here, we show that the mouse skull has the most distinct transcriptomic proﬁle compared with other bones in states of health and injury, characterized by a late-stage neutrophil phenotype. In humans, proteome analysis reveals that the skull marrow is the most distinct, with differentially expressed neutrophil-related pathways and a unique synaptic protein signature. 3D imaging demonstrates the structural and cellular details of human skullmeninges connections (SMCs) compared with veins. Last, using translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET) imaging, we show that the skull bone marrow reﬂects inﬂammatory brain responses with a disease-speciﬁc spatial distribution in patients with various neurological disorders. The unique molecular proﬁle and anatomical and functional connections of the skull show its potential as a site for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating brain diseases.},

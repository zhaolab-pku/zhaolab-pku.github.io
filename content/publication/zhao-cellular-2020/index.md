abstract: Optical tissue transparency permits scalable cellular and molecular investigation
  of complex tissues in 3D. Adult human organs are particularly challenging to render
  transparent because of the accumulation of dense and sturdy molecules in decades-aged
  tissues. To overcome these challenges, we developed SHANEL, a method based on a
  new tissue permeabilization approach to clear and label stiff human organs. We used
  SHANEL to render the intact adult human brain and kidney transparent and perform
  3D histology with antibodies and dyes in centimeters-depth. Thereby, we revealed
  structural details of the intact human eye, human thyroid, human kidney, and transgenic
  pig pancreas at the cellular resolution. Furthermore, we developed a deep learning
  pipeline to analyze millions of cells in cleared human brain tissues within hours
  with standard lab computers. Overall, SHANEL is a robust and unbiased technology
  to chart the cellular and molecular architecture of large intact mammalian organs.

summary: SHANEL permeabilizes aged human organs for deep 3D imaging, enabling transparency, comprehensive labeling, and rapid cell-level analysis.

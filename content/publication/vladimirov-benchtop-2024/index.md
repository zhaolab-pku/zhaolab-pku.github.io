abstract: Abstract In 2015, we launched the mesoSPIM initiative, an open-source project
  for making light-sheet microscopy of large cleared tissues more accessible. Meanwhile,
  the demand for imaging larger samples at higher speed and resolution has increased,
  requiring major improvements in the capabilities of such microscopes. Here, we introduce
  the next-generation mesoSPIM (“Benchtop”) with a significantly increased field of
  view, improved resolution, higher throughput, more affordable cost, and simpler
  assembly compared to the original version. We develop an optical method for testing
  detection objectives that enables us to select objectives optimal for light-sheet
  imaging with large-sensor cameras. The improved mesoSPIM achieves high spatial resolution
  (1.5 µm laterally, 3.3 µm axially) across the entire field of view, magnification
  up to 20×, and supports sample sizes ranging from sub-mm up to several centimeters
  while being compatible with multiple clearing techniques. The microscope serves
  a broad range of applications in neuroscience, developmental biology, pathology,
  and even physics.

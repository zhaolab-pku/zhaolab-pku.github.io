abstract: Abstract  Automated detection of specific cells in three-dimensional datasets
  such as whole-brain light-sheet image stacks is challenging. Here, we present DELiVR,
  a virtual reality-trained deep-learning pipeline for detecting c-Fos + cells as
  markers for neuronal activity in cleared mouse brains. Virtual reality annotation
  substantially accelerated training data generation, enabling DELiVR to outperform
  state-of-the-art cell-segmenting approaches. Our pipeline is available in a user-friendly
  Docker container that runs with a standalone Fiji plugin. DELiVR features a comprehensive
  toolkit for data visualization and can be customized to other cell types of interest,
  as we did here for microglia somata, using Fiji for dataset-specific training. We
  applied DELiVR to investigate cancer-related brain activity, unveiling an activation
  pattern that distinguishes weight-stable cancer from cancers associated with weight
  loss. Overall, DELiVR is a robust deep-learning tool that does not require advanced
  coding skills to analyze whole-brain imaging data in health and disease.

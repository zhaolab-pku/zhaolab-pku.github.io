abstract: Tissue imaging has become much more colourful in the past decade. Advances in both experimental and analytical methods now make it possible to image protein markers in tissue samples in high multiplex. The ability to routinely image 40â€“50 markers simultaneously, at single-cell or subcellular resolution, has opened up new vistas in the study of tumour biology. Cellular phenotypes, interaction, communication and spatial organization have become amenable to molecular-level analysis, and application to patient cohorts has identified clinically relevant cellular and tissue features in several cancer types. Here, we review the use of multiplex protein imaging methods to study tumour biology, discuss ongoing attempts to combine these approaches with other forms of spatial omics, and highlight challenges in the field.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Multiplex protein imaging advances tumor biology by revealing cellular interactions and spatial organization. This review discusses its applications, integration with spatial omics, and challenges.

abstract: The coupling reactions of diaryltetrazoles with carboxylic acids under UV
  irradiation were investigated. Application of these transformations in chemical
  biology was demonstrated in photo-labelling the proteinogenic carboxylic acids in
  purified proteins, cell lysates and living cells. ,  The photo-induced reactions
  of diaryltetrazoles with carboxylic acids in aqueous solution were investigated.
  Besides measuring the apparent second-order rate constant and evaluating the functional
  group compatibility of these reactions, we further incorporated the tetrazoles into
  SAHA, leading to a new active-site-directed probe for labelling HDACs in both cell
  lysates and living cells.

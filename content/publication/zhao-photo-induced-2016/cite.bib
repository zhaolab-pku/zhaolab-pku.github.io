The photo-induced reactions of diaryltetrazoles with carboxylic acids in aqueous solution were investigated. Besides measuring the apparent second-order rate constant and evaluating the functional group compatibility of these reactions, we further incorporated the tetrazoles into SAHA, leading to a new active-site-directed probe for labelling HDACs in both cell lysates and living cells.},

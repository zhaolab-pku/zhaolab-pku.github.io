abstract: Efficient syntheses of 4- epi -galiellalactone and the corresponding activity-based
  probe enabled chemoproteomic studies to reveal the biological targets.  ,   The
  [6,5,5] tricyclic fungal metabolite galiellalactone is a Michael acceptor that has
  been demonstrated to be a covalent inhibitor for Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription 3 (STAT3). Recognizing the ring strain associated with the skeleton
  of this natural product, we utilized 1 R -5 S -bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one as the
  starting material and developed two novel approaches to accomplish the enantioselective
  total synthesis of the C4 epimer of galiellalactone in 5 and 7 steps, respectively,
  which capitalized on an efficient radical cyclization/fragmentation cascade reaction.
  Furthermore, an activity-based probe of 4- epi -galiellalactone with a terminal
  alkyne tag was successfully prepared to enable the experiments of activity-based
  protein profiling (ABPP). Through western blot and proteomic analysis, we not only
  confirmed the known target STAT3, but also identified a new target protein ataxin-7,
  which formed a covalent bond with the probe in intact cells via the Cys-129 residue.

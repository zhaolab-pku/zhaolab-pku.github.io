abstract: Abstract  Efficient and accurate nanocarrier development for targeted drug
  delivery is hindered by a lack of methods to analyze its cell-level biodistribution
  across whole organisms. Here we present Single Cell Precision Nanocarrier Identification
  (SCP-Nano), an integrated experimental and deep learning pipeline to comprehensively
  quantify the targeting of nanocarriers throughout the whole mouse body at single-cell
  resolution. SCP-Nano reveals the tissue distribution patterns of lipid nanoparticles
  (LNPs) after different injection routes at doses as low as 0.0005 mg kg −1 —far
  below the detection limits of conventional whole body imaging techniques. We demonstrate
  that intramuscularly injected LNPs carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA reach heart tissue,
  leading to proteome changes, suggesting immune activation and blood vessel damage.
  SCP-Nano generalizes to various types of nanocarriers, including liposomes, polyplexes,
  DNA origami and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), revealing that an AAV2 variant
  transduces adipocytes throughout the body. SCP-Nano enables comprehensive three-dimensional
  mapping of nanocarrier distribution throughout mouse bodies with high sensitivity
  and should accelerate the development of precise and safe nanocarrier-based therapeutics.

abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with long-lasting neurological symptoms,
  although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using optical clearing and imaging,
  we observed the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the skull-meninges-brain
  axis of human COVID-19 patients, persisting long after viral clearance. Further,
  biomarkers of neurodegeneration were elevated in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid from long
  COVID patients, and proteomic analysis of human skull, meninges, and brain samples
  revealed dysregulated inﬂammatory pathways and neurodegeneration-associated changes.
  Similar distribution patterns of the spike protein were observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected
  mice. Injection of spike protein alone was sufﬁcient to induce neuroinﬂammation,
  proteome changes in the skull-meninges-brain axis, anxiety-like behavior, and exacerbated
  outcomes in mouse models of stroke and traumatic brain injury. Vaccination reduced
  but did not eliminate spike protein accumulation after infection in mice. Our ﬁndings
  suggest persistent spike protein at the brain borders may contribute to lasting
  neurological sequelae of COVID-19.

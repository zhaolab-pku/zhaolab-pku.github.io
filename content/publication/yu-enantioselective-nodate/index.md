abstract: Ampilectane and serrulatane natural products are structurally and stereochemically
  complex compounds that display various potent pharmacological activities ranging
  from anti-inflammatory to anti-tuberculosis. A general synthetic route towards this
  family of natural products has been developed, which accomplished a number of amphilectane
  and serrulatane natural products. The key step employed a stereoselective Cope rearrangement
  either promoted by gold catalysis or thermal conditions, while a regioselective
  gold-catalyzed 6-endo-dig cyclization was optimized to afford a precursor. The preparation
  of the chiral β-ketoester as a starting material was established via an optimized
  asymmetric 1,4-addition followed by trapping with Mander’s reagent, and this initially
  installed stereogenic center provided good control in the subsequent introduction
  of all the other stereocenters. A rarely investigated one-pot conversion of α-pyrone
  into phenol was also examined to enable the syntheses. DFT calculations explain
  the high stereoselectivity of the Cope rearrangement of the intermediate that eventually
  led to amphilectolide and caribenol A.

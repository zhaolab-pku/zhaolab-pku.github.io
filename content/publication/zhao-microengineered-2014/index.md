abstract: Cardiac ﬁbrosis greatly impairs normal heart function post infarction and
  there is no effective anti-ﬁbrotic drug developed at present. The current therapies
  for cardiac infarction mainly take effect by eliminating occlusion in coronary artery
  by thrombolysis drugs, vascular stent grafting or heart bypass operation, which
  are capable to provide sufﬁcient blood ﬂow for intact myocardium yet showed subtle
  efﬁcacy in ameliorating ﬁbrosis condition. The advances of in vitro cell/tissue
  models open new avenues for drug assessment due to the low cost, good controllability
  and availability as well as the convenience for operation as compared to the animal
  models. To our knowledge, no proper biomimetic in vitro cardiac ﬁbrosis model has
  been reported yet. Here we engineered an in vitro cardiac ﬁbrosis model using heart-derived
  ﬁbroblasts, and the ﬁbrogenesis was recapitulated by patterning the substrate rigidity
  which mimicked the mechanical heterogeneity of myocardium post-infarction. Various
  biomarkers for cardiac ﬁbrosis were assayed to validate the biomimicry of the engineered
  platform. Subsequent addition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway inhibitor
  reduced the ratio of myoﬁbroblasts, indicating the feasibility of applying this
  platform in screening anti-ﬁbrosis drugs.

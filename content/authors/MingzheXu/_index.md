Mingzhe Xu will join the laboratory as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2026.  
He earned his bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences (Elite Program) from Sichuan University, where he ranked among the top students of his cohort.  

During his undergraduate studies, he developed strong expertise in molecular and cellular biology, focusing on mechanisms of tumor growth, energy stress adaptation, and ribosome biogenesis. His research work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica (ABBS)*.  

In his doctoral research, Mingzhe will explore three-dimensional imaging and staining technologies for proteomic and transcriptomic analysis within tissue clearing systems, aiming to integrate molecular profiling with spatial biological context.
